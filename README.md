## Getting Started

To get started with using our healthcare AI models and examples, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run the sample applications.

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in order. Each step builds on the previous ones, and jumping ahead may require restarting deployments that can take significant time to complete. Detailed documentation is linked for each step if you need additional context.

- **Azure Subscription** with access to:
  - Azure Machine Learning workspace _or_ permissions to create one.
    - See [required permissions](#required-permissions) for details and [Step 3](#step-3-deploy-healthcare-ai-models) for deployment options.
  - Models deployed or permissions to deploy them into a subscription or AzureML workspace.
    - See [Step 3](#step-3-deploy-healthcare-ai-models) for deployment options and tips on selecting models.
  - GPU compute resource availablity (quota) for model deployments.
    - See [Step 1](#step-1-verify-prerequisites-quota) for details.
  - **Optional**: Azure OpenAI access for GPT models (limited use in examples).
- **Tools**:
  - **For running examples**:
    - [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy) for downloading sample data
    - Python `>=3.9.0,<3.12` and pip `>=21.3` (for running locally)
  - **For deploying models**:
    - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-linux)


### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites (Quota)

Before deploying, verify your Azure subscription has sufficient quota and your account has the necessary permissions to avoid resource limitations during deployment.

**Azure Quota Management Tools**
- [Azure Machine Learning Quota Management](https://ml.azure.com/quota) - For GPU compute quota
- [Azure AI Management Center](https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/quota) - For Azure OpenAI quota management

**Quota Requirements** 

You need quota for **one or more** of the following:

| Model | VM Family | Instance Type | Instance Count | Cores per Instance | Min Cores Needed |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **MedImageInsight** | NCasT4_v3 | `Standard_NC4as_T4_v3` | 2 | 4 | **8 cores** |
| **MedImageParse** | NCadsH100_v5 | `Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5` | 1 | 40 | **40 cores** |
| **CXRReportGen** | NCadsH100_v5 | `Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5` | 1 | 40 | **40 cores** |
| **Prov-GigaPath*** | NCv3 | `Standard_NC6s_v3` | 1 | 6 | **6 cores** |
| **GPT-4o or GPT-4.1** (optional) | GlobalStandard | GPT-4o or GPT-4.1 | - | - | **50K-100K TPM** |

*Used in advanced demos only

> [!TIP]
> **Healthcare AI Models**: All healthcare AI models (MedImageInsight, MedImageParse, CXRReportGen, Prov-GigaPath) require GPU compute quota as shown above.
>
> **GPT Models (Optional)**: GPT models are deployed to Azure AI Services with Tokens Per Minute (TPM) capacity instead of compute cores. GPT deployment is completely optional and can be skipped by leaving the `AZURE_GPT_MODEL` environment variable empty.
>
> **Quota Management**: We recommend requesting quota for **all models** and requesting **2-3x+ the minimum cores** shown above. Requesting quota does not incur any charges - you only pay for what you actually use. Having extra quota available prevents deployment delays and allows for scaling when needed.
> 
> **⚠️ ONGOING COSTS**: Online model endpoints bill continuously while deployed, even when not actively processing requests. Monitor your usage in the Azure portal and use cleanup procedures when finished (see deployment-specific instructions in the deploy folders).

#### Required Permissions:

**To run examples only**: If models are already deployed by your admin, you only need access to the deployed model endpoints. Your admin can provide you with revelevant information and authentication credentials.

**To deploy models yourself**: 
- **Fresh deployment**: Requires **Owner** role OR **User Access Administrator + Contributor** roles on the Azure subscription to create resource groups, workspaces, and configure role-based access controls.
- **Existing deployment**: Requires **Contributor** role on the resource group containing your existing Azure ML workspace.

> [!TIP]
> If you lack deployment permissions, ask your IT administrator to either grant you the appropriate access in a resource group or deploy the models for you and provide the endpoint details.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/healthcareai-examples.git
cd healthcareai-examples
```

### Step 3: Deploy Healthcare AI Models

The examples in this repository require AI model endpoints to be deployed. We provide several deployment methods to accommodate different workflows and preferences.

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ COST ALERT**: Deploying these models will create Azure resources that **incur charges**. Online model endpoints **continue billing even when idle**. Review the [quota requirements table](#step-1-verify-prerequisites-quota) to understand compute costs before proceeding. See deployment-specific cleanup instructions in the respective deploy folders when finished.

> [!TIP]
> **Not all models are required:** you can deploy only the subset you need for specific notebooks.
> **For basic examples**: Deploy only the specific model you want to explore:
>  - `cxrreportgen/` notebooks → **CXRReportGen** model
>  - `medimageinsight/` notebooks → **MedImageInsight** model  
>  - `medimageparse/` notebooks → **MedImageParse** model
>
> **For advanced demos**: You'll need **MedImageInsight** + **Prov-GigaPath** (plus others depending on the specific demo).
> See [Model Selection](./docs/deployment-guide.md#model-selection) in the deployment guide to select specific models.

#### Automatic Deployment - Recommended

The Azure Developer CLI provides automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration. See the [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md) for more information. You can use the [Quickstart Deployment](docs/deployment-guide.md#quick-start) or choose the option that matches your situation:

> [!TIP]
> **Authentication Issues?** If the standard login commands fail (especially in constrained network environments or when using certain authentication methods), try using device code authentication instead:
> - `az login --use-device-code`
> - `azd auth login --use-device-code`
> 
> This opens a browser-based authentication flow that can work around common login issues.

**Deploy into your existing Azure ML workspace:**

*Recommended if:*
- ✅ You're running from an Azure ML workspace compute instance
- ✅ You have an existing workspace you want to use
- ✅ You have Contributor permissions (no role assignment permissions needed)

  *Quick Start*
  ```bash
  cd deploy/existing
  az login
  azd auth login
  azd env new <envName>
  # Auto-configure environment from current AML compute instance:
  ./setup_azd_env_for_aml.sh
  azd env set AZURE_GPT_LOCATION "southcentralus"
  azd env set AZURE_GPT_MODEL "gpt-4.1;2025-04-14"
  azd up
  ```
  See [Existing Deplpyment Guide](deploy/existing/README.md) for more details.


**Create a Fresh AML Environment**:

Creates a new resource group and Azure ML workspace from scratch.

*Recommended if:*
- ✅ You want to run the examples locally
- ✅ You need a completely new workspace setup
- ✅ You have Owner or User Access Administrator permissions
- ⚠️  Note: May be slower if you don't have a stable connection
  
  *Quick start*
  ```bash
  cd deploy/fresh
  az login
  azd auth login
  azd env new <envName>
  azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>
  azd env set AZURE_GPT_LOCATION <gpt_location> # if different from AZURE_LOCATION
  azd env set AZURE_GPT_MODEL "gpt-4.1;2025-04-14"
  azd up
  ```
  See [Fresh Deplpyment Guide](deploy/fresh/README.md) for more details.

> [!TIP]
> **GPT Model Integration**: Both deployment options now support optional GPT model deployment (GPT-4o or GPT-4.1) alongside healthcare AI models. This enables multimodal workflows combining medical imaging AI with language models. See the deployment guides for configuration details.

> [!NOTE]
> **For Admins**: You can deploy resources on behalf of another user by setting `AZURE_PRINCIPAL_ID` to their Azure AD object ID during deployment. This grants the target user access to the deployed resources while you maintain the deployment permissions. This is useful when deploying fresh infrastructure where role assignments are created.

#### Manual Deployment Methods

For users who prefer other deployment approaches, we provide instructions for:

- **[Complete Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)** - Comprehensive guide covering all deployment options with troubleshooting.
- **[Manual Deployment](docs/manual-deployment.md)** - Portal and SDK deployment methods.

### Step 4: Setup your local environment

> [!CAUTION]
> If you followed the automatic deployment steps, you might currently be in either the `deploy/fresh/` or `deploy/existing/` directory. You should move back to the repository root level.

Now that you have deployed the models, you need to configure your local environment to use them effectively. This invols three key tasks: verifying your environment configuration, installing the required toolkit, and downloading sample data.

#### Verify Your Environment File

After deployment, verify that your root level `.env` file contains the necessary environment variables for connecting to your deployed models. Each automatic deployment method will configure this file with the appropriate settings for your chosen approach. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the value of `DATA_ROOT` in your `.env` file to ensure it's appropriate for your setup. The default value is `/home/azureuser/data/`, but you may need to modify it based on your environment. If you change the `DATA_ROOT` value, you'll also need to update the destination path in the azcopy command in the following step.

> [!NOTE]
> If you used a manual deployment method you will have to configure this file yourself, see [Manual Deployment](docs/manual-deployment.md) for more information.

#### Download Sample Data

The sample data used by the examples is located in our Blob Storage account. Use [azcopy tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy) to download:

```sh
azcopy copy --recursive https://azuremlexampledata.blob.core.windows.net/data/healthcare-ai/ /home/azureuser/data/
```

> [!TIP]
> This downloads the entire dataset. For specific examples, you can download subsets by appending the subfolder name to the source URL.

#### Install Healthcare AI Toolkit

Install the helper toolkit that facilitates working with endpoints, DICOM files, and medical imaging:

```sh
# Standard installation
pip install ./package/
```
_or_
```sh
# Editable installation for development
pip install -e ./package/
```

After installation, you can test your endpoint connectivity:

```sh
# Test all configured endpoints
healthcareai-test

# Test specific model endpoint quietly
healthcareai-test --models cxr,pgp --quiet
```
