# HealthcareAI Examples

This repository contains a examples for healthcare AI, providing various examples to streamline the use of the models in the Microsoft HealthcareAI ecosystem. Use the samples in this repository to explore and implement healthcare AI scenarios.

**Disclaimer**: _The Microsoft healthcare AI models, code and examples are intended for research and model development exploration. The models, code and examples are not designed or intended to be deployed in clinical settings as-is nor for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health or medical condition, and the individual modelsâ€™ performances for such purposes have not been established. You bear sole responsibility and liability for any use of the healthcare AI models, code and examples, including verification of outputs and incorporation into any product or service intended for a medical purpose or to inform clinical decision-making, compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, and obtaining any necessary clearances or approvals._

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/healthcareai-examples.git
    cd healthcareai-examples
    ```

2. **Set up your environment**:

    ### 1. Prerequisites

    To run most examples, you will need to download the data and have an appropriate endpoint deployed.

    #### Download data

    Use the following command to download the dataset with samples into your data folder located at `/home/azureuser/data/healthcare-ai/`:

    ```sh
    azcopy copy --recursive https://azuremlexampledata.blob.core.windows.net/data/healthcare-ai/ /home/azureuser/data/
    ```

    #### Deploy and configure an endpoint

    To run the examples you will need to access to a Azure-deployed endpoints:

    **Model Endpoints**

    You can use the the SDK to programmatically deploy the endpoints:
    * [MedImageInsight deployment](https://aka.ms/healthcare-ai-examples-mi2-deploy) 
    * [MedImageParse deployment](https://aka.ms/healthcare-ai-examples-mip-deploy) 
    * [CXRReportGen deployment](https://aka.ms/healthcare-ai-examples-cxr-deploy)

    #### Set up .env file

    You need to set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file. An example file named `env.example` is provided in the repository. Copy this file to create your own `.env` file:

    ```sh
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    After copying, open the `.env` file and fill in the values.


    #### Sample Toolkit Installation

    **Prerequisites**

    - Python version: `>=3.9.0,<3.12`
    - pip version: `>=21.3`

    Many examples require the `healthcareai_toolkit` package. Install it by running the following command in the repository root:

    ```sh
    pip install package
    ```

    If you wish to edit the package easily, you can also install it in editable mode using the `-e` flag:
    
    ```sh
    pip install -e package
    ``` 

3. **Examples and Sample Code**:
    Explore the notebooks in the `azureml` directory to see various examples of how to use the healathcare ai models.
